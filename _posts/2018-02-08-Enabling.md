### Set up port forwarding on Virtual box VM network setting
* stop the vm if already running
* in network setting, under NAT, click port forwarding
* create forwarding rule to link port 22 in guest to arbitrary `your-port-number` (e.g. 2222) in host, & leave other columns blank
* save configs, test by:
* start the vm instance
* `ping 127.0.0.1:<your-port-number>`

### If using connecting to VM on remote server
* make sure open the port with firewall rule
* e.g. in CentOS
* `sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=<your-port-number>/tcp --permanent`

### Enable remote debugging on PyCharm
* under Tools -> deployment -> configurations, add sftp
* put `remote-ip-address` as the address, host port configured in previous step as port, alongside with other configurations necessary
* test in configuration setup page
