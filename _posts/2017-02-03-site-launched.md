Today my site is finally released. I\'ve been considering writing my own blog starting from last semester. However, the effort failed at that time due to heavy loads of job hunting and semester long projects. Now that everything is settled, it is possible to launch this site.

Main purpose for this site is to share some insights, ideas, and notes on my professional interest, not limited to Software Engineering, Computer Science, and Data Science. Blog provides with a relatively large space for detailed logical explaination. It is also my hope that through such format can I express myself clearly and carefully. Hope anyone read my blog learn something, and exchange thoughts with me. I\'m more than glad to discuss with you.

Another purpose is to have the most fundamental ideas on front-end. Those ideas require frequent practices to be prefect. For an entry level SE personnel, it\'s more than vital to have a routine practices.

This site includes a brief bio, a slightly out-of-date resume, and most importantly, blogs. Future iteration may include brief intro on my git repos, prettified format, etc.

The site is managed by Jekyll. Credit to this [tutorial](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/#).
